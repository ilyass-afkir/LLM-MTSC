# Coming Soon: LLMs for Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC)

This repository contains code and material for my thesis on range prediction for electric trucks using large language models applied to time-series data. The work builds on prior research in vehicle energy modeling and focuses on pre-development software and electronics. While state-of-charge estimation is established in research, the use of large language models for driving scenario classification is not widely covered. This project studies time-series classification as a source of context for range prediction models.

However in this case the UEA MTSC dataset is used to evalute the models against 2 benchmarks InceptionTime and Rocket.
