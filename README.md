# LLMs for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting

This project studies the use of LLMs for multivariate time series classification.

The implementation uses datasets from the UEA benchmark for training and evaluation.
The model pipeline supports LLaMA-3 models and related variants.

The project is under development. Training and inference workflows are available.
